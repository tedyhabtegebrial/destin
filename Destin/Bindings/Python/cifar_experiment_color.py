This script defines a "go()" function which will train DeSTIN on CIFAR images ( see http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html )
and then presents the DeSTIN beliefs on a self organizing map ( SOM ).

See http://www.mediafire.com/view/?17ehjc28z922g#um21dwtl1lz1f8v for a screen shot of this script.
Each colored dot represents an image. The color of the dot is determined by the image class such as dog or airplane.
The self organizing map should put simular images near each other.

If you click on SOM it will show you CIFAR image of the nearest dot.

consider belief propagation delay. For a static image, if there are
4 layers, then it will take 4 iterations for the upper layers to
start seeing anything, unless we implement a way to only enable 1
layer processing at a time to avoid the propagation delay.

Since the image is static, I dont think it would need previous belief recurrence.
I don't understand how the parent nodes would be able to help the bottom nodes.

If doing 8 iteration per image, then since half the time the top layers will be seeing
junk beliefs, the training on those top ones should be disabled
